OpenFrameworks Boids

This *has* been done [before](https://github.com/after12am/ofxBoids) but I'm doing it as an exercise for myself and to hopefully had more features and differences.

I intend to fully pick apart every mathematical element as I code it to fully understand how it is all working. Once it's all working I also intend to pick it apart for efficiency and speed too, which is something very new to me.

_TODO:_
- Add furthur Craig Reynolds behaviours.
- Split classes into boid > prey > predator
- Add flocking behaviour.
- Add visual elements (nice looking debug mode);
- Environmental factors?
